# my-linux

List of hardware, applications, and tools that make my Linux experience amazing. I have a [similar list](https://github.com/obahareth/my-mac-os) from back when I used to be on macOS which was originally inspired by https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os.

## Applications

I'm slowly transitioning to cross-platform software because I want to be able to use the majority of my apps on any OS.

### Productivity

#### [Albert](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert) - Launcher

- Open source alternative to [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).
- Alfred is both my launcher and clipboard history manager (via CopyQ). See [this article](https://medium.com/curiouscaloo/macos-to-ubuntu-part1-alfred-replacement-7864b4d26397) for a nice setup/tutorial.

#### [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) - Simple and quick task manager

- Todoist helps me plan out everything I want to do either for the short term or long term (I'm not sure if I follow GTD).

#### [Trello](https://trello.com) - Project management tool

- Simple project management tool with tons of great integrations.

#### [Pipefy](https://pipefy.com) - Automation on boards and forms

- When I need something like Trello but with a lot more automation/power (e.g. having a public form, sending emails when things move to a certain column, triggering other actions, etc.)

#### [1Password](https://1password.com) - Password manager

- Generate all of my passwords with it and keep everything in a secured and encrypted vault kept secure by a master password and two factor authentication.
- No longer need to remember passwords and I now have a unique password for every website that I am signed up on whilst [activating two factor authentication](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/) wherever possible.

### Code

#### [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) - Code editor

- My favorite editor that I use to write code in. I use [many extensions](https://wiki.omar.engineer/vscode/extensions) for it.
- I use the [Nord](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code) theme, [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) and the [Pragmata Pro](https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/) font.

Here is how it looks:

#### [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - Powerful text editor

- Opening, editing, modifying, and searching through huge files.
- Go-to commandline text editor.
- I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage plugins.

#### [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) - Terminal Emulator

- I use Fish as my shell together with [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) to install [Fish plugins I use](https://wiki.omar.engineer/fish/plugins).
- You can find my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/obahareth/dotfiles).
- I use the [Pure prompt](https://github.com/rafaelrinaldi/pure) and the [Nord theme](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-hyper).

#### [GitKraken](https://www.git-tower.com) - Git client

- Great cross-platform Git client that integrates well with GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, and supports GitFlow.
- Supports signing commits via GPG.

### Social

#### [Rambox](https://github.com/ramboxapp/community-edition) - Open Source Multi-messaging App

- A single app I use for chatting with people on:
  - Telegram.
  - WhatsApp.
  - Messenger.
  - Discord.

#### [Slack](https://slack.com) - Work chat

- Chatting for work.
- Collaborating with people on some open source projects and great communities.
- I use the [Nord theme for the sidebar](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-slack) and also apply a [Nord stylesheet](https://github.com/tborychowski/slack-nord-theme) so everything looks Nord-ish.

It looks a bit like this (the screenshot is from the slack-nord-theme repo):

#### [Mailspring](https://getmailspring.com) - Email client

- Great dark theme.
- I approach all of my email tasks in GTD style. Keeping my email Inbox close to 0 at all times.

### Writing

#### [Notion](https://notion.so) - Large writing, scans, web clips, and annotations

- I do my huge writing here.
- If I want to access a document from anywhere, I usually store it here.

### Music

#### [Google Play Music](https://play.google.com/music) - Music Streaming

- My goto music streaming solution.
- Easiest for me to setup from where I live (Saudi Arabia).

#### [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) - Music Streaming 2nd solution

- Google Play Music will most likely be merged with this, so it might be best to get used to it.
- I use it on the rare occasion that I don't find something on Google Play Music.

### Images

#### [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/) - Cloud storage for photos

- Easiest way to backup my photos and access them from multiple places.
- Machine learning, auto detects images.
- ðŸ˜– Kind of scary.

### Utilities


#### [Plank](https://launchpad.net/plank) - Awesome Dock

- A dock that I managed to get to be very similar to my macOS dock.

#### [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) - Great API tool

- Full-featured HTTP client that lets you test and describe the APIs you build or consume.

### Browsers

#### [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

- My main web browser because it easily syncs my extensions across machines.
- I use [these extensions](https://wiki.omar.engineer/google-chrome/extensions) and [this theme](https://wiki.omar.engineer/google-chrome/theme).
